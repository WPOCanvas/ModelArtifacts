This is the initial stage where you come up with an idea to solve an identified problem. It is important at this stage to take a complete view of the problem domain. Explore different possibilities before locking down on a focused product concept.

Study and analyze different paths and possibilities the new solution may take. Team activities include brainstorming for idea generation as well as studying competitive offerings and researching publications from the marketplace. This phase is like the Divergence and Discover phases of the Design Thinking process.
